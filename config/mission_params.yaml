  waypoint_interval: 10.0        # meters between waypoints
  overlap_percentage: 30         # camera overlap percentage

# Detection Parameters
detection:
  model_path: "/home/dj/Projects/Nidar--2025-ELKA-/best_model/dj_yolo_best/weights/best.pt"
  confidence_threshold: 0.70     # minimum confidence for detection
  nms_threshold: 0.45            # non-max suppression threshold
  target_class_id: 0             # class ID for 'person'
  frame_skip: 2                  # process every Nth frame for performance
  # ByteTrack settings
  use_tracking: true             # enable ByteTrack object tracking
  tracker: "bytetrack.yaml"      # tracker config file
  box_smoothing: 0.6             # bounding box smoothing factor (0-1)

# Payload Configuration
payload:
  initial_count: 10              # number of payloads loaded
  drop_altitude: 10.0            # meters above ground for drop
  servo_channel: 9               # MAVLink servo channel
  servo_drop_pwm: 2000           # PWM value to trigger drop
  servo_hold_pwm: 1000           # PWM value to hold payload
  drop_stabilize_time: 2.0       # seconds to stabilize before drop

# Safety Parameters
safety:
  min_battery_voltage: 14.0      # volts - trigger RTL below this
  min_battery_percent: 20        # percent - trigger RTL below this
  max_distance_from_home: 500    # meters - geofence radius
  failsafe_rtl_altitude: 30.0    # meters - RTL altitude
  connection_timeout: 5.0        # seconds - max time without heartbeat
  gps_fix_required: true         # require 3D fix before takeoff

  frame_width: 1920
  frame_height: 1080
  reconnect_delay: 2.0           # seconds before reconnect attempt
  # Geotagging calibration (for GSD-based coordinate calculation)
  sensor_width_mm: 7.6           # Horizontal sensor size in mm
  focal_length_mm: 4.4           # Camera focal length in mm
  gimbal_pitch_deg: 90           # 90 = nadir (straight down), 0 = horizontal

# Logging
logging:
